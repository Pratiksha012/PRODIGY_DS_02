## Objective
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

In my notebook I have performed data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on both the test and train datasets.

The dataset was downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data
